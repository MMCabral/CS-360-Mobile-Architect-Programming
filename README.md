Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
  -To develop this app I was required to build an app with multiple screens one being a user login and the other being a main page to contain my app functionality. 
  I chose to create an inventory app that grab and collected user input and would notify the user when their supply is low. Also, I had to include sms alerts on this
  app that the user could choose to opt in or out from.
  
What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
  -The screens necessary for me was first the login screen where the user could create an account or login to the app. Next was the home screen that collected all the user 
  inputed data and would display it for them to see. I made a few alternative screens like for when they are adding items, choosing to recieve sms alerts and when
  the user wants to access their home or setting on a navigation screen. I kept the user in mind in all these decisions because I did not want to clutter the screens with
  too much information making it confusing for the user.
  
How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?
  -I approached my app any way I approach anything, I try to clear my mind then focus on what I am tasked with completing. I like to make a task list of things I need to complete
  in order for my project to be successful. There are times I find myself overwhelmed and when I feel that happening I usually have to step away from my desk for sometimes a few hours 
  or the night to clear my head to start fresh. I feel spending time stepping away will help me think about the problems I am having in my code and will help me figure out solutions.
  
How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?
  -I would test my code often to make sure I would not over code and then run into a million issues when running my code. I spent a good amount of time using the debugger 
  on my code to find things such as typos, etc. I think this is important because it can help me progress without being overwhelmed with errors.
  
Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
  -Overall the whole project was a challenge for me because this was not something I had used before. I had some experience with java but never in android studios. I found myself 
  a lot of research and having to spend time practicing different functionalities that I wanted to include in the final app development.
  
In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
  -I think the component I was most successful in was creating the login I think it was exciting being able to develop that functionality. My favorite part of the app development
  will always being creating the UI but that is not the that challenging.
